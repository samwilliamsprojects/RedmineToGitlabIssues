This directory was made to query the entire Redmine Issues Database provided by my company. It dates over 7 years and a lot of issues. It is pretty messy data that was cleaned up in the issue_engineering Jupyter notebook.
You should likely dig around the SQL database if using this notebook or my scripts to make sure the same information is in yours as mine. If the MySQL dump used the same tables (my company was not able to verify if this is the case), it should be usable with very little adjustment.
